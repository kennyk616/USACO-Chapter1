----Update-----
Trying to refamilarize myself with Java and algorithms, so I've decided to re-do all the challenges. 



Unfortunately I accidentally deleted the 1st 15 files for this Chapter, right before I created this repository on github (for this very reason...oh the irony). As a result, only the last 6 problems are uploaded here. I don't plan on going back and redo the 1st 15 problems any time soon, unless it is for a different language (C++ or C).
